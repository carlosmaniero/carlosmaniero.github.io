Title: We've got lost in tech

Yeah! A lot of shit is going on in tech recently. I've friends who lost their jobs
because some rich-white-guy with enough money to keep several generations of his family tree
away from work could not handle seeing their company stocks going down.
Or because some other rich-white-guy thinks that the only way to get stuff done is by
working a hundred hours a week and worst, without knowing where to go. All this crap makes me
think a lot about the current state of tech...

## All is vanity

Before writing  down my thought on tech I'd like to talk about my relationship with the
Internet and how it affetcs my career.

I made a lot of things to get promoted and no shame on it, but also there are a whole lot of
things that I made for my ego, and _"welcome to the internet! Come and take a seat"_.
That is how the internet works! We expose ourselves to massage our egos. That sucks!

As an ex-software consultant, I've talked a lot about how important it is for companies to be
data-driven. 
Every time I posted on [Medium](https://maniero.medium.com/),
I spent weeks following the numbers, looking at how many views and claps I had.

I'm talking about 50 readers/month it is not like I hit at least once, even though I was
obsessed to see the numbers growing at least a little. 

No numbers, no anxiety. I rebuilt my personal blog and I removed every single tracking script from my blog.
The only two companies that will know you read this article are 
Microsoft (I'm using Github pages) and your ISP.

I'd like to write because I like to do so, not because I would like
to be a tech reference or anything like it. Time was easy when there wasn't so many things
happening at once and so much data to monitor.

## Simplicity not allowed!

Back to the tech business, the same thing happens when we are coding. 
We don't code for fun at work. We code for money. But we also code to prove ourselves to our
coworkers. And this is a problem.

In one of my jobs, I needed to present a list of five **hard-coded** items in a specific
order. I solved the issue in 2 minutes. I took the list and manually sorted it.
To my surprise, PR rejected! The argument was that the list could grow and engineers
could break the sorting when adding a new item.
Then we designed how the sort would behave based on a set of the entity's properties.

After a year that list recieved two extra items. The list never grew that much but that
chunk of code received more and more complexity.

## Make stuff working

It has been a while since I've had fun coding. It does not mean that I've been frustrated
at work. I found joy in other activities, such as product management and leadership.
But I'm still a software developer and have no intention of switching roles. In my free time,
I'm going back to the basics: I started again to study how computers work. 

To learn how simple things used to be is amazing. We have new and more complex challenges,
no doubt. But the challenges and how we handle them look completely out of proportion to me.

Last week I learned how to print "Hello World" only using BIOS's Legacy Boot.
It only took me a couple of assembly lines. Sometimes
that's all that I'd like... To sit into my chair, to code and see it working.

## Scaling 

I know that we need to scale. I also know that scale almost ever leads to complexity.
This complexity should be handled cautiously. When companies start to worry about scale,
they hire like there will be no paychecks. 
All that people need to work, and guess what we do?

We start splitting the application into small business units. Sometimes these business units
are so small that holds only a little chunk of the customer's experience. Once we've got there,
it is almost impossible to roll back. You gonna need more and more developers,
the complexity will not stop growing. A simple feature will require changes in
several services, needs to be aligned with multiple teams. Of course, it take a lot of time
to be done. 

## The infinite money era is gone

For the last few years, we have been living like there is infinite fundraising. But that
time is over. The result: Layoffs. As a software engineer, you may not have control
over the stock market (if you do, let's be friends, please!).
But you do have control over the complexity of your team's solution.
Make stuff simple as your job depends on it. Because it does.
