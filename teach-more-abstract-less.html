    <p>As developers progress in their careers, they often find themselves in a
position to enhance team productivity. It’s only natural for senior developers
to keenly observe where their teams face technical challenges.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: Your colleagues are grappling with a new tool that the
team collectively decided to adopt. Perhaps you championed this choice due to
your familiarity with the tool. During the team’s learning curve, you noticed a
dip in productivity.</p>
<p>In a stroke of brilliance, you decide to build an abstraction layer on top of
the tool. You invest days, maybe even weeks, implementing this abstraction.
Your team approves, and your colleagues appreciate the newfound ease.
Productivity returns to its previous level, and all seems well.</p>
<p>Yet, there’s a catch. Occasionally, the abstraction needs extensions. Your
teammates, less comfortable with the underlying tool, hesitate to make these
changes. To prevent them from spending excessive time wrestling with both the
abstraction and the tool, you step in and handle the modifications.</p>
<p>Fast forward: You take a well-deserved vacation. During your absence, the team
faces a situation requiring adjustments to the abstraction. Suddenly, they’re
caught in a bind—they must navigate both your abstraction and the underlying
tool. The end result? The once-elegant abstraction don't look so great anymore.</p>
<p>You could blame the labor rights, after all, who needs more than two or three
days of vacation?</p>
<p>You might be tempted to blame labor rights—after all, who needs more than a
couple of days off? But let’s focus on the heart of the matter: abstractions.
They demand cautious handling. Before creating one, consider whether your team
can effectively support it. Abstractions should never be the first answer to
knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>In fact, creating abstraction to help junior developers to perform is the
most perverse solution for their careers. It inadvertently robs them of
valuable learning opportunities and autonomy. Usually these abstractions
lacks documentation leaving junior team member with no reliable reference
point.</p>
<p>So, here’s an alternative approach: Teach before you abstract. Invest time in
mentoring your colleagues. Pair with them, share knowledge, and foster a
collaborative environment. When the team collectively decides to abstract
something, everyone will possess the necessary foundation to contribute
effectively.</p>
