@chapter Teach More, Abstract Less

As developers progress in their careers, they are driven to improve their
team's productivity. Senior developers starts to observe where their teams are
struggling technically and help their colleagues to grow, however sometimes
such help comes as a white elephant.

Consider this: your colleagues are struggling to work with a new tool that you
all decided to use. You drove this decision because you have some affinity with
it, and during your team's learning curve, you saw the team's productivity
drastically going down.

You then have a brilliant idea! To create an abstraction on top of that tool.
You spend a few days, maybe some weeks implementing such abstraction. You had
your team's approval, your colleagues gave you the feedback that it is easier
for them now, even the team's productivity is back at the previous state.

There was one or two cases where the abstraction needed to be extended, your
teammates were not comfortable performing such changes because they don't know
the tool very well, and to prevent them to spend too much time on it you made
these changes.

But you went off on vacation a few weeks, during that time some change on the
abstraction needed to be made, the team had such a bad time doing so. At that
point, they had to lean both - the abstraction and the tool. When you returned
to work with the aid of a sunburn, you figure out that the once beautiful
abstraction don't seems so great anymore.

You could blame the labor rights, after all, who needs more than two or three
days of vacation?

Abstraction are something that need to be performed in a very cautious way, you
need to understand if your team is able to support such abstraction. To create
an abstraction to solve an knowledge issue is never a good idea.

Actually, creating abstraction to help junior developers to perform is the most
perverse solution for their careers. You took them the opportunity to learn and
their autonomy. These abstractions are usually not well documented and they
will have no search engine to turn to.

So, before abstracting it, help people to learn. Teach your colleagues, pair
with team. So, if you all decide to abstract something everyone will have the
knowledge base required to do so.

Thank you Johnny Richard for reviewing and for the feedbacks.
