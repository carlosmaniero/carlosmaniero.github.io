  <article>
    <p>Software testing has long been a critical component of ensuring software quality. 
If you are familiar with the ACCELERATE book, you'll know that continuous delivery
is key to achieving a high-performance organization, and a good testing strategy 
is essential to enable it.</p>
<p>There are many resources about testing, integration tests, unit tests, TDD, and so on.
I would like to have a more abstract discussion about what you should to consider
before taking decisions on testing. </p>
<p>Long story short, after several meaningful discussions with many teams, 
I've noticed that we always end up with four key principles, 
which I describe using the acronym <strong>W.O.R.D.</strong></p>
<h2>W.O.R.D.</h2>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>Works</strong>.</li>
<li>It <strong>Orients</strong> the development and code design.</li>
<li>It is easy to <strong>Refactor</strong>.</li>
<li>It is a <strong>Debugging</strong> tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It WORKS!</h2>
<p>One of the main concerns in software quality is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"satisfy the customer through 
 early and continuous delivery of valuable software".
 <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Manifesto</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any testing strategy must provide the safety that any change that passes all tests 
can be ship to production with no fear. A testing strategy that covers the application
into different levels is required to reach that confidence. </p>
<p>It also requires a team that fully understands that software quality is a role of all.
Testing culture is an important matter here and  Developers should not write tests
just to reach a quality gate metric. </p>
<h2>It ORIENTS the development and code design!</h2>
<p>A good testing strategy should make the development process easier by allowing you to 
test small parts of a complex solution individually.</p>
<p>Also, tests can provide valuable insights into the quality of your code. 
If the test is too complex to read and cannot be simplified, 
it may indicate a code smell not in the test itself but in the production code.</p>
<h2>It is easy to REFACTOR!</h2>
<p>I often hear people complaining about how tests make their life miserable during the 
refactoring process. Tests are not supposed to break during a refactor. 
If it does, it is a smell that your tests are not focusing on at the crucial point of
any application: Its behavior.</p>
<p>Developers sometimes focus too much on implementation details. 
If tests are too tightly coupled to the implementation, refactoring can be difficult
and time-consuming. It's important to strike a balance between testing implementation
details and testing the application's behavior.
Avoid relying too heavily on mocks and instead, focus on validating the behavior of the
application.</p>
<h2>It is a DEBUGGING tool</h2>
<p>No application is completely bulletproof, and bugs will inevitably occur.
When they do, your testing strategy must be capable of simulating these issues.
If you're unable to replicate a bug, it suggests that there are certain scenarios that
your test strategy isn't covering, which directly impacts the <strong>"It Works"</strong> principle.</p>
<p>Ensure that your testing strategy adapts to your application's increasing complexity.</p>
<hr>
<p>With these four principles in mind, it's important to iterate and constantly evaluate your
testing strategy with your team. Ensure that you are covering all four principles and 
look for ways to improve your testing approach. These simple principles can help you make 
better and more informed decisions about your testing strategy.</p>
